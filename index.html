                After a decade of constant isolation, the world gradually became sick of each other. 
                Isolating with the family became "every man for themselves". In order to survive this post-apocalyptic world
                you need to purchase military-grade weaponry. The purpose of this website is to sell our customers in this
                post-apocalyptic world with our arsenal with the currency we view to be valuable. money isn’t useful, but what is 
                useful food. If you own a farm you are a millionaire in our eyes. All of our items will be sold 
                for chickens or water (water being the more valuable currency) however if you have something else you can 
                trade please let us know before your purchase. Our delivery service is only for people within the UK as shipping doesn’t exist
                and we are not going to fly over to you unless you pay a premium. When we deliver our goods don’t try to use our weapons against us
                as they can’t function once we are dead and they don’t do any damage to us anyway so don’t bother. Finally, 
                we are currently looking for employees who are hardworking and the best way to confirm your place for working with us
                you can send footage of you dealing with our "competitors".
